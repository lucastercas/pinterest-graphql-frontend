I made this site to learn how to user graphql, it is a site that users can 
see images uploaded by others, and comment on them or upload images themselves
if they login.

This is the frontend of the project, made using react.

The dotenv file you can use the one on this repo, or create one yourself:

1. REACT_APP_GRAPHQL_URL is the url of the graphql backend
2. REACT_APP_URL is the url of the frontend, of this project

The other variables have to start with REACT_APP_, else the dotenv of react
will not recognize them.
